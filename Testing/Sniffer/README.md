# Clock Signal Sniffer

A hardware and software solution for capturing and analyzing the signal protocol of radio-controlled clock modules. This project specifically focuses on the **TFA Dostmann 60.3518.01** module that uses DCF77 to maintain time synchronization.

## Project Overview

The Sniffer consists of:

1. **Hardware**: ESP32-based sniffer device with digital inputs connected to the clock module signals
2. **Firmware**: Real-time signal capture and logging system
3. **Analysis Tools**: Python scripts for data analysis and protocol decoding
4. **Results**: Discovered timing protocols and signal encoding details

## Hardware Setup

The Clock Sniffer uses an ESP32 microcontroller to monitor digital signals from the TFA Dostmann clock module:

### Connections

| ------ | ---------------------- | --------- |
| RF     | Radio Frequency signal | GPIO 36   |
| MU     | Minute Unit signal     | GPIO 39   |
| PON    | Power ON signal        | GPIO 34   |
| BA     | BA signal              | GPIO 35   |

### Voltage Level Adaptation

The clock module operates at a lower voltage level (1.5V) than the ESP32 (3.3V), which creates a challenge for signal level conversion:

- **Voltage Threshold Issue**: ESP32 GPIO inputs have a TTL minimum high level voltage of 2.0V, while the clock signals peak at only 1.5V.

- **MOSFET Limitations**: Many MOSFETs require at least 2.0V on $V_{th}$ (threshold source-grid) to switch properly, making them unsuitable for this application.

- **Recommended Approach**: The latest version of this project uses a **LM339N comparator** with a 1.0V reference voltage to reliably detect the clock's 1.5V signals.

- **Alternative Components**: Other level shifters could be used but many suitable options (like the MX14611) are not widely available.

#### Important Operation Note

When the clock module is not powered:

- The inputs of the LM339N become unstabilized
- This can generate numerous false edges on the ESP32 inputs
- In extreme cases, this may trigger an "Emergency buffer flush" as the buffer fills with noise

**Recommendation**: Do not leave the ESP32 recording for extended periods when the clock module is unpowered. While this situation is electrically safe, it will create data files filled with meaningless signal transitions.

## Firmware Features

The firmware is built around efficient event capturing and reliable storage:

- **Real-time Signal Monitoring:**

  - Captures both rising and falling edges of all signals
  - Uses interrupts for precise timing measurements
  - Records timestamps using ESP32's `millis()` function

- **Signal Monitoring:**

  - All signals (RF, MU, PON, and BA) are continuously monitored
  - Records both rising and falling edges for all inputs

- **Memory-Efficient Data Buffering:**

  - Thread-safe ring buffer for storing events
  - Buffer capacity of 4096 events (>2.5 hours of data)
  - Each event occupies 8 bytes (signal type, edge type, timestamp)

- **Reliable Data Storage:**

  - Data stored on SD card in CSV format
  - Periodic data flushing (every minute)
  - Resilient to SD card insertion/removal
  - Automatic header creation for new files

- **Visual Status Feedback:**
  - GREEN: System OK, all data committed
  - PURPLE: SD card missing, data pending
  - RED: Buffer overflow, logging stopped
  - Blinking RED: System panic (fatal error)

## Analysis Tools and Results

### Python-Based Analysis

The project includes Python scripts for analyzing the captured signals:

- **csv2vcd.py**: Converts CSV log files to Value Change Dump (VCD) format for visualization in tools like [GTKWave][gtkwave] or [PulseView][sigrok]
  - Automatically splits output into multiple files when timestamp resets are detected
  - Handles ESP32 resets or timestamp overflow cases
  - Naming convention: output.vcd, output_1.vcd, output_2.vcd, etc.
- **Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with signal analysis and protocol decoding

### Protocol Discovery

The analysis revealed the following about the [TFA Dostmann 60.3518.01][tfa] clock module's signal protocol:

1. Communication occurs through the BA and MU signals
2. When BA goes high, MU transmits an encoded time value
3. The encoding follows this pattern:

   ```plaintext
   0b1TTUUUU
   ```

   Where:

   - TT: tens digit (0, 1, 2)
   - UUUU: units digit (0-9)

4. Complete protocol timing:
   - BA goes high
   - 4ms later, MU pulses its encoding:
     - 8ms high pulse (first bit)
     - 6 bits encoding the time (TT and UUUU), each 8ms
     - 4ms high pulse to end the frame
   - Both MU and BA fall at the same time
   - The entire frame lasts 64ms

### Examples of Decoded Time Values

| Time  | Binary Code |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 01:00 | 0b1000001   |
| 03:00 | 0b1000011   |
| 10:00 | 0b1010000   |
| 13:00 | 0b1010011   |
| 23:00 | 0b1100011   |

## Building and Using

1. **Build the firmware:**

   - Clone this repository
   - Open in PlatformIO
   - Configure any settings if needed
   - Build and upload to ESP32

2. **Collecting data:**

   - Connect the ESP32 to the clock module according to the pin definitions
   - Insert an SD card (formatted as FAT32)
   - Power up the system
   - Let it run for the desired duration
   - Remove SD card to access the data files

3. **Analyzing data:**
   - Copy the CSV files to the `_data` directory
   - Convert to VCD format using `csv2vcd.py`

      ```bash
      python scripts/csv2vcd.py _data/yourfile.csv
      ```

   - If the source CSV contains timestamp resets (from ESP32 resets or timestamp overflow), multiple output files will be generated automatically (e.g., output.vcd, output_1.vcd, output_2.vcd)
   - Run the Jupyter notebook `Analysis.ipynb` to process the data
