# GrannyClock Testing Projects

This directory contains various testing and prototyping projects that were developed as part of the GrannyClock project. Each subdirectory represents a specific module or component that required testing, debugging, or reverse-engineering during the development process.

These mini-projects were essential for solving critical technical challenges and validating different approaches before integration into the final GrannyClock firmware and hardware design.

1. **Prototyping:** Rapidly testing ideas and approaches before committing to the final design
2. **Validation:** Verifying that components work as expected in isolation
3. **Reverse Engineering:** Understanding proprietary protocols and interfaces
4. **Parameter Tuning:** Finding optimal settings for mechanical and electrical components
5. **Integration Preparation:** Ensuring components will work together before final assembly
